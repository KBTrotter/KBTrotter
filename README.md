### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a sophomore Computer Science and Engineering student at the University of Nevada Reno. I have completed technology certifications in networking and cybersecurity, and I spent two years working for an IT company that services several school districts in Northern Nevada. During that time, I strengthened my ability to troubleshoot hardware and software issues as well as my customer service and teamworking skills. 
I am particularly interested in using technology in a multidisciplinary way. As an undergraduate researcher at UNR, I worked on a project that connects machine learning to forestry and gained new technical skills in the process. 

#### I'm passionate about all things technology and eager to learn more!

## Languages: C++, Python, C
